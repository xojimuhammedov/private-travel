                Welcome to magnificent Samarkand - the most ancient city of
                Uzbekistan and Central Asia. Samarkand is one of the greatest

                Bibi-Khanum Mosque, Shakhi-Zinda Necropolis and Ulugbek's

                The legendary Samarkand square of Registan has up to now been
                considered to be one of the main architectural sights of Central
                Asia. The monuments of Samarkand are majestic and wonderful. In

                An excursion to Samarkand by car is the solution. Going by car
                means that you aren't tied to strict schedules and you are free

                cotton field.
