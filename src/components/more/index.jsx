                Tashkent is the capital of Uzbekistan and one of the largest
                city in Central Asia (fourth largest international city in the
                post-Soviet Union). It has existed for more than 2200 years. Its
                architectural monuments are not so known as ones of Samarkand,
                Bukhara, Khiva, but geographical location and the rough history
                of the city connected to its position predetermined the special
                color of Tashkent, which has been the main center of political,
                economic and cultural life of the whole region for more than 150
                years.
